# Nasa-Space-Apps-Hack-2017

I participated in NASA Space hack 2017 where I made a space simulator under a budget constrain. This one was special because our team (Team Kepler) stood 2nd globally out of 25 thousand plus participants and we were the first team from our country to qualify for final round. The aim was to educate students about space and cultivate there interest in space exploration. The simulator was developed using virtual reality and embedded systems, where an individual could experience a realistic space shuttle launch. The virtual reality system was an integrated with a dynamic chair with directional vibration feedback and a glove which allowed the user to interact in the virtual reality. An AI chat bot was also added which acted as an astronaut's assistant. The complete product including the chair was developed out of the sensors given at the event. The end product was so good that every one from organisers to other participants wanted to try it out. The awe on everyone face made us realised that we had built something to be proud of.
